# The To-Do App



## Description

*Duration: 10hrs*

This web app is a to-do list that features a table with columns for your task, the date is it due by, if and when it was completed, and buttons to mark your task completed or delete the task from the table. 

I created this to-do list for someone on the job. Something that helps them keep track of due dates and daily tasks that need to be completed. I wanted to give the to-do list a calming background to help relieve any work day stress they may be feeling.
